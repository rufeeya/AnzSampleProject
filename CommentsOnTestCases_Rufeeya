Once you are done connecting to db, you can have postive and neagative test cases

like..

for posiive, hav a actual list that fetches acc list for userid that is present using a @mock userRepository obj (when then)
and hav an expected list that goes thru service (@injectmock) and fetches for that user id, and compare these 2

for negative, for expected use an userid that is not present or a different userid so that the results dont match
like assertnotequals for size oflists something like that
